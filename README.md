This is a Password Generator API.

I started this small but scalable project to help myself get more hands on experience completing a whole project from start to finish.
Also to help build my knowledge whilst also trying to remember coding patterns.

I'm going to add a list of enhancements for future development work items, which will not only keep me engaged and motivated to code whilst learning but to see what I can scale this application to be.

This is a very basic project but with the aim to build up my skills. Will be interesting to look back upon this once I have a lot more experience.
